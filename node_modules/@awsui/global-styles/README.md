# @awsui/global-styles

[AWS UI](https://github.com/aws/awsui-documentation) is a collection of [React](https://reactjs.org/) components that help create intuitive,
responsive, and accessible user experiences for web applications. It is developed by [Amazon Web
Services (AWS)](https://aws.amazon.com/). This work is available under the terms of the
[Apache 2.0 open source license](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.txt).

This package provides global styles for [AWS UI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@awsui/components-react) components.


This release allows Amazon teams to release open source products that have a dependency on the
AWS UI components. It is just the first step in a larger process of creating a new open source
design system. You can find [more information on GitHub](https://github.com/aws/awsui-documentation).
